CoalCare India: Carbon Footprint Quantification for Indian Coal Mines <br>
Project Overview <br>
CoalCare India is a web-based application designed to quantify carbon emissions from coal mining activities and explore pathways towards carbon neutrality. The application provides activity-wise carbon emission estimates and helps suggest solutions like afforestation offsets, clean technologies, and alternative energy sources to achieve carbon neutrality. It aims to help Indian coal mines align with the country's climate goals by offering transparency and decision-making support for emission reductions. <br>

Features <br>
Emission Estimation: Input mining-related data to calculate emissions from electricity usage, fuel combustion, explosion emissions, and shipping.
Carbon Neutrality Pathways: Explore emission reduction strategies such as adopting cleaner technologies, calculating afforestation offsets, and simulating the use of renewable energy.
Carbon Credit Calculation: Estimate potential carbon credits based on the current market rate of carbon credits.
Data Visualization: Emissions data is presented visually through charts and graphs to track emission trends and reduction strategies. <br>
Technology Stack <br>
Backend: Node.Js <br>
Frontend: React.Js + Tailwind <br>
Database: Firebase (or specify another database) <br>
APIs: Integrated with APIs for emission factor data (if applicable) <br>
